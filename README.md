## First Homework
**Area:** Convolutional Neural Networks - Image Classification

In this homework we were required to classify species of plants, which were divided into categories according to the species of the plant to which they belong. Being a classification problem, given an image, the goal is to predict the correct class label.

### Dataset Details
Image size: 96x96  
Color space: RGB  
File Format: JPG  
Number of classes: 8  
Classes:
- 0: "Species1"
- 1: "Species2"
- 2: "Species3"
- 3: "Species4"
- 4: "Species5"
- 5: "Species6"
- 6: "Species7"
- 7: "Species8"

Training images per class:
- Species1 : 186
- Species2 : 532
- Species3 : 515
- Species4 : 511
- Species5 : 531
- Species6 : 222
- Species7 : 537
- Species8 : 508


### Evaluation
The metric used to evaluate models and place the Teams in Leadeboard was the Total Accuracy.
